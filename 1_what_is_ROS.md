# What is ROS?

The ROS [website](https://www.ros.org/) states,

```
The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications.
From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms, and with powerful developer tools, ROS has what you need for your next robotics project.
And it's all open source.
```

To expand on this a bit further, ROS is not just an algorithms library.
Although there are packages that can help performs things such as [SLAM](https://google-cartographer-ros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [navigation](https://wiki.ros.org/navigation), and [manipulation](https://moveit.ros.org/), ROS also provides a robust communication framework that simplifies things like processing sensor data and communicating with other robots.

ROS is used in both academic and professional settings, playing a major role in things like the [DARPA Subterranean Challenge](https://www.subtchallenge.com/) and even [industrial robotics applications](https://rosindustrial.org/).
One of the great things about ROS is that it is open source, so using ROS is free!
Open source also means that it is possible for you to contribute to ROS as well.
You can either create your own ROS packages or help improve existing ROS packages.
Lots of ROS packages have their source code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

To get a better feel for what ROS is capable of, take a look at the following video that illustrates some of the ways ROS has been applied over a 10 year span: https://vimeo.com/245826128
